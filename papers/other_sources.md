# For learning

* https://habr.com/ru/companies/ruvds/articles/924100/ - About RAG for dummies

# Data

* https://github.com/microsoft/ArxivFormula - Doc layout, includes both by hand and machine ones
* https://github.com/amao0o0/awesome-AI-Math-Datasets - collection of links to different datasets


# Models

* https://huggingface.co/juliozhao/DocLayout-YOLO-DocStructBench - formula extraction
* https://huggingface.co/hantian/yolo-doclaynet - formula extraction, but a bit better


# End-user programs

* https://github.com/opendatalab/PDF-Extract-Kit - unified open-sources PDF-data extraction
* https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR - not tested, but looks good
* https://github.com/mindee/doctr - interesting, but not for formulas

# Algorithms

* https://github.com/sunsmarterjie/yolov12 - YOLOv12, but better (?)
* https://github.com/RapidAI/RapidLaTeXOCR - LaTeX formula parsing, fast one

# Other
