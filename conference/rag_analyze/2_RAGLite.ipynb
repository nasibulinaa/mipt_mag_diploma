      "# Information about K Theory from the Documents\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the provided lecture notes from \"QKlectures(MSJ23).pdf\" by Leonardo Constantin Mihaela, here's information about K theory as presented:\n",
      "\n",
      "## Classical vs. Quantum K Theory\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents focus on **Quantum K Theory**, which is a deformation of classical K theory. In this context:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Classical K theory** refers to the fundamental invariants of topological spaces\n",
      "- **Quantum K theory** extends classical K theory with quantum corrections, forming a ring with additional quantum parameters\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Concepts in the Documents\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Quantum K Ring\n",
      "The quantum K ring of a space X is a ring that extends the classical K-theory ring of X with quantum parameters. The documents note that unlike quantum cohomology, the quantum K theory is **not a graded ring**.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Quantum Grothendieck Polynomials\n",
      "These are a fundamental tool in quantum K theory, pioneered by Lenart and Maeno. They generalize classical Schur polynomials and are used to describe the structure of quantum K rings.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Quantum Whitney Relations\n",
      "For Grassmannians, these relations determine the quantum K ring:\n",
      "```\n",
      "c(S) ⋆ c(Q) = c(C^n) + (-1)^k q\n",
      "```\n",
      "where c(E) is the total Chern class of a rank e bundle E.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Pieri Rule\n",
      "The documents present a combinatorial rule for multiplication in the quantum K ring:\n",
      "- The constants N_μ,d λ,(1) describe how elements multiply\n",
      "- For d ≥ 1, N_μ,d λ,(1) = ⟨Oλ, O(1), (Oμ)∨⟩d\n",
      "- The rule specifies when these constants are nonzero (only when μ can be obtained from λ by removing boxes from the outer rim)\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Presentations of Quantum K Rings\n",
      "The documents discuss presentations for:\n",
      "- Grassmannians (Gr(k;n)): Generated by e1(x),...,ek(x) and e1(x̃),...,en−k(x̃)\n",
      "- Flag manifolds: Work by Lenart, Naito and Sagaki (non-equivariantly) and extended to the equivariant setting\n",
      "\n",
      "## Physics Connections\n",
      "\n",
      "The documents highlight important physics connections:\n",
      "- The ideal of relations in quantum K theory for flag manifolds is generated by partial derivatives of a superpotential from supersymmetric gauge theory\n",
      "- The relations also follow from Bethe Ansatz equations associated with integrable systems\n",
      "- These connections provide a physical interpretation for the combinatorial structures in quantum K theory\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "The quantum K theory framework has applications in:\n",
      "1. Combinatorics (through quantum Grothendieck polynomials)\n",
      "2. Algebraic geometry (for understanding varieties)\n",
      "3. Topology (as a deformation of classical K theory)\n",
      "4. Physics (through connections to supersymmetric gauge theory)\n",
      "\n",
      "The lectures specifically focus on how quantum K theory can be understood through physics considerations, with the quantum Whitney relations for Grassmannians being particularly important in this framework.\n",
